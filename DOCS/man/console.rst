Configuration
-------------

This script can be customized through a config file ``script-opts/console.conf``
placed in mpv's user directory and through the ``--script-opts`` command-line
option. The configuration syntax is described in `ON SCREEN CONTROLLER`_.

Key bindings can be changed in a standard way, see for example stats.lua
documentation.
